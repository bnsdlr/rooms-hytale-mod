## ToDo

- [ ] DO SOME PERFORMANCE/MEMORY OPTIMIZATIONS...
  - [ ] ScoreGroup find all matching block ids at start?
- [ ] rooms
    - [ ] room info ui (where you can change the room type, every 5min, in game day or sth)
- [ ] sets 
  - [ ] make sets way more responsible
    - [ ] support for blocks that occupy more than one block of space
      - [ ] place anywhere on tables
      - [ ] any rotation (of the set)
      - [ ] add required rotation (relative)
    - [ ] able to set rotation for blocks
- [ ] if multiple rooms match, give ability to choose from them.
- [ ] always add root block. the problem is that you cannot call a store method from a system... (at least I don't know how you could do that, or what else is the cause of the IllegalStateException
- [ ] add plaza (doormat, carpet and no door required)
- [ ] effects
