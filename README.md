- [ ] rooms
    - [ ] more complex room definitions
      - [ ] blocks of group
      - [ ] block type
    - [ ] buffs for having room
    - [ ] room info ui (where you can change the room type, every 5min, in game day or sth)
- [ ] sets 
  - [ ] make sets way more responsible
    - [ ] support for blocks that occupy more than one block of space
      - [ ] place anywhere on tables
      - [ ] any rotation (of the set)
      - [ ] add required rotation (relative)
- [ ] if multiple rooms match, give ability to choose from them.
- [ ] always add root block ...
